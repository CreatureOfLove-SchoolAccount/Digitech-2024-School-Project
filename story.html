  <p>Lorem ipsum
Home is where I want to be - pick me and up turn me round - I feel numb - Born with a weak heart - I guess I must be having fun - The less we talk about it the better - Make it up as we go along - Feet on the ground, head in the sky - It's alright, I know nothing's wrong - Nothing - I, I got plenty of time - I, you've got light in your eyes - Never for money, always for love - Cover up and say goodnight - Say goodnight - Home is where I want to be - But I guess I'm already there - I come home, she opened up her wings - I guess that this must be the place - I can't tell one from another - Did I find you, or you find me? - There is a time before we were born - If someone asks, that is where I'll be - Where I'll be - And out of all those kinds of people - You've got the face with a view - I'm just an animal looking for a home - And share the same space for a minute or two - And you'll love me 'til my heart stops - Love me 'til I'm dead - Cover up the blank spots, hit me on the head - I go oooohh</p>
