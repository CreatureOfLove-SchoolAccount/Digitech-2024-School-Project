 Teacups that are flying on maps mystifying, you'll think that I'm lying - This old tale of mine, a journey through time - A permanent fire, cold frost on the pyre - You've seen in your eyes, you've seen in your mind - While the old bow their heads, while the blind lead the blind - The marble loses shine, the eye clouds by design - But we know in our soul, the one hope, the one truth - That if we believe we can, we can make miracles - Even with the devils of time against you, never let the fire fade in you! - See the golden goddess with wings of rainbows set sail through the night sky to embrace you - Resist! Allow your heart to take you - Never let this merciless world erase you - Passing down the light of the torch to guide you - And you shall be bathed in light!
